# Talker Proximity

> The Talker Proximity plugin for FiveM is a plugin that changes the voice range of a player in game. It is also not changeable and will display a dialogue if attempted to be changed.

## About

### Pros

* Easy to install
* Minimal server usage
* Better for Roleplay
* Changable distance

### Cons

* I honestly can't thing of any...

## Changing the distance

To change the distance of the talking range, under the resource folder, and in the cl_talker.lua, change the `proximity` option under the `options` table.

## Coming soon

* Maybe a toggle feature in the options...
* code comments...

I NEED MORE IDEAS OF WHAT TO ADD
